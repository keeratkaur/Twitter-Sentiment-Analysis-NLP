# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

This project implements a sentiment analysis tool that evaluates tweets to determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project utilizes various libraries to preprocess and analyze Twitter data.

## Key Features:
### Data Preprocessing: 
Uses regular expressions to clean tweet data, remove unwanted characters, and eliminate stopwords for more accurate analysis.
### Text Vectorization: 
Converts textual data into numerical format using the TfidfVectorizer, which transforms words into feature vectors.
### Model Training: 
Implements a Logistic Regression model for classifying the sentiments based on the processed data.
### Performance Evaluation: 
Evaluates model accuracy using accuracy score metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
### Libraries Used:
#### NumPy and Pandas: 
For data manipulation and handling dataframes.
#### NLTK: 
For natural language processing tasks, including stopword removal and stemming.
#### Scikit-learn: 
For machine learning tasks, including model training and evaluation
